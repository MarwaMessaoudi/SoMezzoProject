The JwtRequestFilter class in your Spring Security setup is a custom filter that performs the following main tasks:
Summary:
The JwtRequestFilter class is responsible for:
Extracting the JWT from the request header.
Validating the JWT to ensure itâ€™s legitimate.
Authenticating the user by loading their details and setting the authentication in the Spring Security context.
Allowing the request to proceed with the authenticated user if the token is valid.
This enables stateless authentication based on JWT, where no session is required. The user's identity is validated through the token, and the request proceeds with the appropriate authorization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The class JwtUtils is designed to handle the creation, extraction, and validation of JWT tokens.
It allows the extraction of claims (like the subject/email and expiration date) from the token.
It provides functionality to generate new tokens with an expiration time (defaulting to 10 hours) and ensures tokens are valid by checking both the email and expiration.
